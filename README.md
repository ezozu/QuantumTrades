# QuantumTrades: Algorithmic Forex Binary Options Trading Platform

An event-driven platform for backtesting and automated strategy deployment in Forex binary options, utilizing WebSockets and probabilistic payoff modeling.

## Detailed Description

QuantumTrades is a high-performance algorithmic trading platform designed specifically for Forex binary options. Built in Rust for speed and reliability, it provides a robust framework for developing, backtesting, and deploying automated trading strategies. The core of QuantumTrades revolves around an event-driven architecture, allowing for real-time processing of market data and rapid execution of trading signals. This architecture facilitates the efficient handling of large volumes of tick data and enables the construction of sophisticated trading algorithms that can react instantly to market changes.

The platform offers comprehensive backtesting capabilities, enabling users to evaluate the performance of their strategies against historical data. This includes detailed performance metrics such as win rate, profit factor, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio. The backtesting engine supports various timeframes and currency pairs, allowing for thorough strategy validation. Furthermore, QuantumTrades incorporates probabilistic payoff modeling, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the risk and reward associated with each trade. This feature is particularly crucial in binary options trading, where the payoff is fixed, and understanding the probability of success is paramount.

QuantumTrades provides a flexible and extensible platform for automated trading. It utilizes WebSockets for real-time data streaming from various brokers and exchanges, enabling users to connect to their preferred data sources. The platform also offers a well-defined API for programmatically controlling the trading process, allowing developers to integrate their custom strategies seamlessly. With its focus on performance, reliability, and comprehensive features, QuantumTrades empowers traders to develop and deploy sophisticated algorithmic trading strategies for Forex binary options.

## Key Features

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The core of the platform is built on an event-driven model, allowing for asynchronous processing of market data and efficient execution of trading signals. This design ensures minimal latency and high throughput.
*   **Real-Time Data Streaming via WebSockets:** Integrates with multiple Forex brokers and data providers via WebSockets for real-time market data. Supports customizable data subscriptions and error handling. The data structures are defined using Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization and deserialization.
*   **Comprehensive Backtesting Engine:** Allows for rigorous testing of trading strategies against historical data. Provides detailed performance metrics and supports various timeframes and currency pairs. Backtesting results are stored in a SQLite database for further analysis.
*   **Probabilistic Payoff Modeling:** Incorporates a probabilistic model for estimating the likelihood of a successful trade, taking into account factors such as volatility, time to expiration, and strike price. The model uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach to generate a probability distribution of potential outcomes.
*   **Automated Strategy Deployment:** Enables the automated deployment of trading strategies to live trading accounts. Supports customizable risk management parameters and trade execution logic. The deployment process is managed through a command-line interface (CLI) for easy configuration and control.
*   **Extensible API:** Provides a well-defined API for programmatically controlling the trading process, allowing developers to integrate their custom strategies seamlessly. The API is documented using Rust's `rustdoc` tool and provides examples for common trading operations.
*   **Risk Management Module:** Includes a comprehensive risk management module to prevent excessive losses. Features include position sizing, stop-loss orders, and take-profit orders. Risk parameters can be adjusted dynamically based on market conditions.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, chosen for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency capabilities.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, enabling efficient handling of concurrent operations and non-blocking I/O.
*   **Tonic/gRPC:** Used for defining the API and communication protocol between different components of the platform.
*   **WebSockets (Tungstenite):** Provides real-time data streaming from Forex brokers and exchanges.
*   **SQLite:** Used for storing historical data, backtesting results, and configuration settings.
*   **Protocol Buffers:** Used for defining data structures and message formats for efficient serialization and deserialization.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed. You can download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Follow the instructions specific to your operating system.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the QuantumTrades repository from GitHub:
   `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/QuantumTrades.git`
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
   `cd QuantumTrades`
4.  **Build the Project:** Use the Cargo build tool to build the project:
   `cargo build --release`
   This command builds the project in release mode, optimizing for performance.
5.  **Install Dependencies:** Depending on your operating system, you might need to install additional system dependencies for some of the crates used in the project (e.g., SQLite). Check the documentation of the individual crates for specific installation instructions.

## Configuration

QuantumTrades requires several environment variables to be configured correctly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `BROKER_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing the Forex broker's API.
*   `BROKER_API_SECRET`: Your API secret for authenticating with the Forex broker's API.
*   `DATA_PROVIDER_URL`: The URL of the data provider's WebSocket endpoint.
*   `DATABASE_PATH`: The path to the SQLite database file.
*   `RISK_PERCENTAGE`: The percentage of your account to risk on each trade (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).

You can load these environment variables into your Rust code using a crate like `dotenv`.

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the main executable to start the platform.

`./target/release/quantumtrades`

The platform will connect to the configured Forex broker and data provider, and it will start executing the configured trading strategy.

Example usage of the API to fetch historical data:



For detailed API documentation, refer to the generated `rustdoc` documentation after building the project.
