# QuantumTrades: Secure and Efficient Algorithmic Trading Framework

This repository provides a robust and performant framework for building and deploying algorithmic trading strategies using the Rust programming language. QuantumTrades prioritizes security, efficiency, and modularity, enabling developers to create sophisticated trading systems with confidence.

QuantumTrades is designed to address the complexities of modern algorithmic trading. It provides a foundation for handling real-time market data, executing trades through various brokerages, and rigorously backtesting strategies. The core of the framework is built upon asynchronous programming principles in Rust, ensuring that multiple tasks can be handled concurrently without sacrificing performance. We leverage Rust's ownership and borrowing system to guarantee memory safety and prevent common concurrency issues, which are critical in high-frequency trading environments where even minor errors can have significant financial consequences. Furthermore, the modular design allows developers to easily extend the framework with custom indicators, risk management rules, and trading algorithms, making it adaptable to a wide range of trading styles and markets.

The primary goal of QuantumTrades is to empower developers to build and deploy their own trading systems without being bogged down by the complexities of low-level infrastructure. We aim to provide a comprehensive set of tools and abstractions that simplify the development process while maintaining the performance and reliability necessary for successful trading. The framework includes modules for data ingestion from multiple sources, order management with support for various order types, and comprehensive backtesting capabilities. A key focus is on providing clear and concise documentation, along with example strategies, to help developers quickly get started and build their own trading solutions. We believe that by combining the power of Rust with a well-designed framework, we can democratize access to sophisticated algorithmic trading tools.

QuantumTrades is more than just a collection of libraries; it's a complete ecosystem for building and deploying trading strategies. The framework is actively maintained and continuously improved, with a focus on adding new features, improving performance, and ensuring compatibility with the latest market data providers and brokerages. We are committed to providing a stable and reliable platform for developers to build upon, and we encourage community contributions to help us achieve this goal. Whether you are a seasoned quantitative analyst or a software developer with an interest in trading, QuantumTrades provides the tools and resources you need to succeed.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Supports multiple market data providers through a modular interface. Implemented using asynchronous streams to handle high-volume data feeds efficiently. Providers can be added or removed without impacting the core framework. (Uses `tokio` and `async-trait` crates for concurrency).
*   **Order Management:** Provides a unified API for submitting and managing orders across different brokerages. Supports limit orders, market orders, stop-loss orders, and trailing stop orders. Includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms. (Uses a trait-based system for broker abstraction).
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A comprehensive backtesting engine that allows developers to evaluate their trading strategies using historical data. Supports various performance metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and profit factor. Allows for customizable transaction cost models. (Uses a discrete event simulation model).
*   **Risk Management:** Integrated risk management module with configurable rules for position sizing, stop-loss levels, and maximum capital allocation. Implemented as a series of composable filters applied before order execution. (Uses a rule-based engine implemented with Rust's pattern matching).
*   **Strategy Development Kit:** A set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of creating and testing trading strategies. Includes pre-built indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) and a flexible strategy interface. (Utilizes Rust's traits and generics to provide a type-safe and extensible strategy framework).
*   **Asynchronous Architecture:** Built entirely using asynchronous programming principles, allowing for efficient handling of concurrent tasks and high-throughput data processing. Avoids blocking operations and maximizes resource utilization. (Leverages `tokio` runtime for asynchronous execution).
*   **Secure and Reliable:** Leverages Rust's memory safety features to prevent common concurrency issues and ensure the stability of the trading system. Includes comprehensive unit and integration tests. (Employs extensive use of Rust's ownership and borrowing system).

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language, chosen for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, providing the foundation for concurrent and non-blocking operations.
*   **Reqwest:** An asynchronous HTTP client for making requests to market data providers and brokerages.
*   **Serde:** A serialization and deserialization framework for handling data in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
*   **Chronotope:** A date and time library for working with time series data.
*   **Log:** A logging facade for providing consistent logging across the application.
*   **Env_logger:** A logging implementation that reads configuration from environment variables.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure to follow the instructions to set up your environment.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the QuantumTrades repository from GitHub:

    `git clone https://github.com/ezozu/QuantumTrades.git`

3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

    `cd QuantumTrades`

4.  **Build the Project:** Build the project using Cargo, Rust's package manager:

    `cargo build`

5.  **Run the Tests:** Run the unit and integration tests to ensure that the project is working correctly:

    `cargo test`

## Configuration

QuantumTrades uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory or set the environment variables directly in your system. The following environment variables are required:

*   `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER`: The name of the market data provider to use (e.g., `alpaca`, `binance`).
*   `BROKERAGE`: The name of the brokerage to use (e.g., `alpaca`, `interactive_brokers`).
*   `API_KEY`: Your API key for the market data provider and brokerage.
*   `API_SECRET`: Your API secret for the market data provider and brokerage.
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `error`).

Example `.env` file:



## Usage

To run a trading strategy, you need to create a new Rust file that implements the `Strategy` trait. Here's a simple example:



Compile and run this file to start receiving market data and executing your trading strategy. Consult the documentation for the `quantum_trades` crate for detailed information on the API and available modules. (Documentation will be provided separately with API examples).
